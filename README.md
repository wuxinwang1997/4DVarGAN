# 4DVarGAN

This project library is the open source code and datasets for the manuscript: "A self-attention-based neural network for three-dimensional multivariate modeling and its skillful ENSO predictionsA Four-Dimensional Variational Constrained Generative Adversarial Network for Data Assimilation" by Wang et al.

The current project contains the 4DVarGAN model code, training code, and testing code.

We thanks OpenI Community (https://openi.pcl.ac.cn) for providing GPUs to conduct experiments.
